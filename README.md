## Hello Calc

Experimental advanced calculator, reimagined as a modern app.

Why do Javascript calculators have to emulate a physical device? Do we really want to hunt and peck virtual keys on a screen?
On a tablet or smartphone, possibly, but not on a browser running on a computer with a keyboard and mouse.

This experiment reimagines a calculator as a modern serverless app complete with
* Expression evaluator with history stack, variables, expression library
* Graphing
* Editor based block evaluations
* And yes, if you want it, a homage to the desktop calculator (with RPN logic)

This has been built on top of my [hello-gatsby](https://github.com/ChristineTham/hello-gatsby.git) Gatsby starter kit template.
It uses the following technologies:
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)
* [Redux and Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org)
* [MathJS](https://mathjs.org)
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
* [Plotly JS](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
* [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
* [Storybook JS](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
